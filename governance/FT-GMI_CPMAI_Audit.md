## 1. Purpose of This Audit Pack

This document provides a CPMAI-aligned audit record for FT-GMI, a governed macro-diagnostic Model within the Spine ecosystem.

Its purpose is to:
- Demonstrate explicit governance discipline
- Clarify what FT-GMI is and is not
- Establish audit-ready traceability without implying deployment, forecasting, or decision automation

This audit pack does not seek certification approval, funding, or production authorization.

## 2. System Classification (CPMAI Framing)

Classification:
- Analytical / Diagnostic Model
- Research & Decision-Support Context

Explicitly not:
- Production system
- Automated decision engine
- Forecasting or optimization engine

Primary function:
Evaluate macro-regime stability & stress transmission across long historical horizons using normalized diagnostic signals.

---

## 3. Scope Boundary (Hard Constraints)

FT-GMI is bounded to:
- Historical & quasi-historical macro data
- Regime diagnostics
- Comparative stress behavior analysis
- Descriptive aggregation only

Out of scope:
- Forecasting
- Portfolio optimization
- Trading signals
- Automated decisions
- Real-time execution
- Online learning

## 4. Lifecycle Governance (CPMAI)

### Business Understanding
Objective defined prior to modeling.  
Research question is fixed and non-adaptive.

### Data Understanding
- Public macroeconomic data
- No personal data
- No protected attributes
- No proxy discrimination vectors

### Data Preparation
- Canonicalized upstream in the Spine
- Versioned inputs
- No ad-hoc transformations inside scoring logic

### Modeling
- Deterministic transformations
- No black-box optimization
- No hidden state learning

### Evaluation
- Internal consistency
- Historical coherence
- Interpretability

### Deployment
- Not deployed
- No production endpoints
- No automation hooks

## 5. Risk & Controls

| Risk | Control |
|---|---|
| Misuse | Explicit non-claims |
| Over-interpretation | Diagnostic labeling |
| Bias | Not applicable |
| Drift | Version freezes |
| Reproducibility | Locked inputs |

---

## 6. Transparency

- Traceable inputs
- Named metrics
- Explicit aggregation logic
- Interpretable regime narratives

---

## 7. Artifacts

- Versioned source code
- Data manifests
- Diagnostic outputs
- Governance notes
- Champion / freeze records

---

## 8. Non-Claims Statement

FT-GMI does not claim:
- Alpha
- Prediction
- Investment suitability
- Economic causality

FT-GMI does claim:
- Structural diagnostic consistency
- Regime-conditional interpretability
- Historical stress comparability

---

## 9. Audit Readiness Declaration

This document reflects the complete state of FT-GMI as of the date above.
Any future extension requires version increment and scope re-approval.
This system state is eligible for a governance freeze.
All known technical debt is declared.
Future changes require version increment and evidence map update.


### Human Oversight

All FT-GMI outputs are interpreted by a human analyst.
No automated decisions, alerts, or actions are generated.
Outputs are contextual, descriptive, and require domain judgment.
