"""
GeoScen™ — US geography and migration macro leaf (skeleton).

This package defines the conceptual interfaces and schemas for GeoScen_US,
a CPMAI-aligned module intended to capture place-based economic dynamics:
    - migration pressure
    - housing turnover and burden
    - labor import/export
    - demographic shifts
    - regional macro "scent" signals

Implementation is intentionally minimal at this stage:
    - No hard dependency on external historical datasets yet
    - No assumption about specific 1950+ global sources
    - Focus on clear interfaces, documentation, and testability

GeoScen is designed to be fused into MAIN_p as a structural driver of:
    - inflation asymmetry
    - regional growth dispersion
    - geography-sensitive factor rotation (e.g., VinV)
